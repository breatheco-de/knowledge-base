🔥 Creating interactive tutorials has never been so easy.

LearnPack is an interactive tutorial builder that allows content creators to build interactive and auto-graded tutorials with near-zero steps or friction.

Reducing the friction when creating a tutorial:
You can easily create exercises with interactive instructions and automated tests by using LearnPack. Learnpack scans your current folder looking for markdown files that will become tutorial instructions and unit-test files that will grade the student.

## Features:
* **Markdown support:** Add a bunch of README.md files and LearnPack will recognize them as tutorial or exercise steps. Discover our improved markdown features for personalized experiences.
* **Language Compilation:** Install any language plugin and make learnpack compile your student solutions in html/css, vanillajs, javascript, python, react.js, and other languages.
* **Automated tests:** Optionally add test.js files and LearnPack will recognize them as automated tests for your exercises using jest. Python, PHP, and other languages are also supported.
* **Very flexible configuration:** We want to allow the creators to configure what they want, creating a more personalized experience. Using the learn.json file, you can change the properties to personalize different features.
* **Zero steps for creators or students:** Learnpack scans your tutorial folder and starts running the tutorial immediately, no additional steps for anyone.
* **Inside your environment:** Run the tutorial directly in your own environment, and take advantage of your user computer settings.
* **Interactive instructions:** You can easily create great interactive instructions with LearnPack as we use markdown for the instructions file.
