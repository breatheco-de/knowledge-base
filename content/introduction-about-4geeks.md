# Introduction about 4Geeks

This time, we don't want to start the article by telling our whole story as 4geeks. Our purpose here is to bring you a little up-to-date on what we have been working on for many years, to offer you the best education from a different perspective ;).

From the very beginning, our mission at [4Geeks](https://4geeks.com/about-us) has been all about making a positive impact by shaking up the old-fashioned methods of teaching. We did our homework, and we came to the conclusion that traditional education system was just not cutting it anymore. It wasn't giving students the hands-on experience, real-life applications, and the motivation they needed to thrive. That's when we knew it was time for a change!

We're firm believers that learning should be fun, hands-on, and motivating. That's why we've come up with a special way of teaching that combines the best aspects of education. Our ***[special formula](https://4geeksacademy.notion.site/4geeksacademy/Mastering-Technical-Knowledge-984d2df394c44aedb05987311ccfcf06)*** is a scientific framework that focuses on **Memory Retention** üß†, **Feedback Quality** üó£Ô∏è, **Learning Mastery** üí°, and **Motivation** üí™. With this approach, we make sure you will get a well-rounded and effective learning experience. We've worked with experts and studied how to create an environment, curriculum, and tools that boost learning effectiveness and will help you become proficient in your technical skills.
